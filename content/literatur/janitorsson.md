	I’m the janitor’s son  
	and I’m gonna be the one  
	that day will come  
	that I’ll be the one  
  
	hold me closer tiny dancer  
	yes, we will find the answer  
	slowly we make love  
	we’re in heaven above  
  
	there’s a fire burnin’ deep in me  
	that I didn’t wanna see  
	there’s love that I can give  
	even if I’m afraid to live
