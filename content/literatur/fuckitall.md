	the limits of limitless   
	the apparition of illusion    
	the imperfection of perfect   
	the crudeness of beauty   
	the loneliness of net-worked as blow-jobbed   
    
	u power up your computer  
	to realize your thoughts destroyed  
	by all means to help anyone else but you  
	brought to u by petty soft engineers  
	imagining their worst opposite
